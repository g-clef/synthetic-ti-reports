    "# Making Synthetic TI reports\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal here is to fine-tune/train a language model on Threat Intelligence reports, and then use that model to generate new, fake, TI reports. I'm doing this mostly because I think it will be funny.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this experiment, we're doing this with a very basic LSTM, rather than any of the fancier GPT or transformer models. (walk before you run and all that.)\n",
    "\n",
    "In any case, the process here is:\n",
    " * collect a ton of TI reports. This is what the https://github.com/g-clef/ThreatIntelCollector is for.\n",
    " * parse them all to extract the text (that's what the prefect job in this repo is for)\n",
    " * make a fastai databundle out of them\n",
    " * instantiate a language learner\n",
    " * train it\n",
    " * predict text\n",
    " \n",
    "This should be fairly straightforward, and I imagine this is going to be wonky at best. Ways to improve it that I can see right off the top:\n",
    " * replace the vendor URLs at the bottom of every page\n",
    " * parse out other URLs/hashes/DNS names/file paths in the report?\n",
    " * try gpt-2 (will it fit in my video card?)\n",
    " * try other fancier transformer libraries\n",
    " \n",
    "For now, though, let's just do the default/easy one."
